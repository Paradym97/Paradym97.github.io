I am a Physical Oceanography Ph.D. candidate in my final year at the Ocean University of China (OUC), advised by Prof. Zhao Jing. 

**I am actively seeking postdoctoral opportunities** in Europe, the US, or Australia within research groups that specialize in ocean and climate modeling. 

My research explores ocean dynamics, air-sea interactions, and the critical role of mesoscale processes in the global climate system. I have a strong background in numerical modeling and a deep interest in how physical ocean processes interact with global warming scenarios.

### Research Experience

**Ph.D. Research: Air-Sea Interaction & Ocean Heat Uptake**
During my doctoral studies, my research has evolved through three interconnected phases:
* **Mesoscale Air-Sea Interaction:** I investigated the spatio-temporal variability of surface turbulent heat flux feedback for mesoscale sea surface temperature anomalies in the global ocean.
* **Model Development (HC-ROMS):** Building on my air-sea interaction research, I am currently developing the Hybrid Coupled Regional Ocean Modeling System ([HC-ROMS](https://github.com/Paradym97/HC-ROMS)), a novel framework that couples ROMS with an empirical atmospheric model. 
* **Ocean Heat Uptake:** My most recent work focuses on qualitatively analyzing the impact of mesoscale eddies on ocean heat uptake within the context of global warming, utilizing Earth system models.

**Master's Research: Turbulent Mixing & Internal Waves**
Also completed at OUC under the supervision of Prof. Zhao Jing, my Master's research centered on the parameterization of wind-driven turbulent vertical mixing. Key projects included:
* Improving parameterizations of wind-driven turbulent vertical mixing based on eddy-resolving climate models.
* Analyzing the distinct roles of global cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies in regulating near-inertial internal waves in the ocean interior.

### Technical Expertise
I am a highly capable modeler with a strong foundation in scientific computing:
* **Numerical Models:** CESM, ROMS, and HC-ROMS (Developer).
* **Programming & Parallel Computing:** Python, Fortran, C, MPI, and currently expanding my toolkit with Julia.
